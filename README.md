## 👨‍⚕️ The Intersection: Medicine x Technology
I operate at the convergence of **clinical precision** and **software engineering**. 
As a medical student, I understand the complexities of healthcare; as a developer, I build the tools to navigate them. My mission is to fuse these disciplines to create applications that are not just functional, but transformative.

## 🛠 What I Build
I focus on creating high-utility software and automation solutions.

- **🚀 Automation & Scripting:** I build Python tools (like data cleaners and validators) to eliminate repetitive tasks and optimize efficiency.
- **💻 Application Development:** Designing robust software that solves specific daily problems for users.
- **📊 Data Logic:** Applying the analytical rigor of medical diagnosis to debugging and code logic.
- **🏥 Future Vision:** Developing MedTech solutions that streamline patient data, assist in diagnostics, and improve hospital workflows.
